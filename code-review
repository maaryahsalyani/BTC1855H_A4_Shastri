Code review 
Line 8: Good job removing the missing value values the same time as loading the data set using the na.strings parameter
Spaces effectively removed from names 
Line 14: effective use of the pipe operator to chain multiple operations (replace missing values with “unknown” and remove rows where country column is blank)
Maybe add “print()” at the end of operations so that it is easy for the user to view the outcomes while reading the code 
Can also consider using more descriptive names for variables (ie. instead of ufo.data1, can say updated_data) to avoid errors 
Line 22: please check over: the code, ufo.data1$datetime <- as.Date(strptime(ufo.data1$datetime, format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M")), does not provide the time when printed into the console. Consider using the  as.POSIXct function as it converts the date into a format that accounts for the time component 
Line 25: Good application of the mutate and grepl function to find all combinations of the word "hoax" in comments column and create new column 
Hoax percentage table appears to display correct values and countries 
Line 37:  Appears to correctly have removed the rows that have a report before sighted
Good analysis of the “duration seconds” column. You ensured that all values were numeric, positive, checked for missing values and the range 
Good critical thinking applied when considering duration seconds greater than 86400 (over 1 day), and effectively removing them in the histogram 
Line 61: Histogram looks concise, well labeled, and easy to read. Good use of log10 to make axis values smaller  
Overall, code is clearly and concisely documented
